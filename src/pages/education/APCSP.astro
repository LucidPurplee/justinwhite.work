            AP Computer Science Principles (AP CSP)
          </h1>

          <p>
            AP CSP gave me a solid foundation in the fundamental logic behind
            computers. The course included a crash course in Python and provided
            opportunities to build numerous micro-projects that reinforced
            concepts in programming, algorithms, and computational thinking.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Primary Achievement</h2>
          <p>
            My main project was developing a <span
              class="tooltip underline"
              data-tip="Provided useful utility functions for reading/writing individual pixels, not directly exposed by the gfx library."
            >
              <strong>rendering utility library</strong>
            </span>
            for the graphics tool in our environment. Using only Python’s built-in
            math utilities (no external libraries), I implemented <span
              class="tooltip underline"
              data-tip="Perlin noise is smooth, pseudo-random noise for natural textures."
            >
              <strong>Perlin Noise</strong>
            </span>
            directly on the canvas. I extended the library for a prototype that could
            <span
              class="tooltip underline"
              data-tip="Encoding/Hashing algorithms convert raw data to a simpler format that is easier to transmit, compress and obfuscate."
            >
              <strong>encode the canvas to a hash (and then back again)</strong>
            </span>, demonstrating algorithmic skill, creative problem-solving,
            and technical independence.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Exam & Results</h2>
          <p>
            Completed the AP CSP Exam, earning a
            <span
              class="tooltip underline"
              data-tip="Scores are on a zero to five range. Four demonstrates near mastery."
            >
              <strong>four</strong>
            </span>, demonstrating strong proficiency in programming concepts,
            data analysis, and understanding the broader impacts of computing on
            society.
          </p>

          <p>
            Overall, AP CSP honed my programming foundations, provided hands-on
            project experience, and taught me to approach technical challenges
            creatively—skills that I continue to apply in larger software
            projects today.
