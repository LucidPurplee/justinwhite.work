# Justinwhite.work 🎉

![Banner](/banners/jwworkbanner2.png)

### Hey! I'm Justin. 👋

I'm a South Carolina–based SNHU student studying **computer science**. I’m exploring **frontend engineering, UX design, and project management**, and learning how to turn ideas into clean, usable products.

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me cooking, baking, or out walking/hiking *(when it’s not a trillion degrees)*.

Messing around with **automation, frontend experiments, and backend systems**. Some projects ship; some fail. All teach lessons.

### Colorama (Sparkade)
A small games studio project backed by investors, giving it real-world traction. I’m the primary engineer, handling most of the code and asset work, while collaborating with other stakeholders to shape the product.  
The project teaches me about **shipping games, teamwork, and managing resources under real-world expectations**.
