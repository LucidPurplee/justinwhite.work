# Justin White (.work) 🎉

![Alt text](/banners/jwworkbanner.png)

Hey! I'm Justin. 👋  
I code, though I'm not super focused on any single area of computer science—my current education leans toward IT. My goal is to work my way into being a **data center engineer** 🖥️ or a **backend engineer** 🛠️ of some kind.  

Outside of work, I like to cook, bake, hike when it's not a billion degrees, and snuggle with my pets. Also probably gay 🏳️‍🌈, so I have impeccable interior design and music taste (or so I'd like to think😅).

## Learning Adventures 📚

Here's what I've been diving into lately:  

- **Google IT Support** 🛠️ – *Sep 2025 – Present*  
- **Google IT Automation** 🤖 – *Aug 2025 - Oct 2025* ✅  
- **Google Project Management** 📋 – *Sep 2025 – Present*  
- **Google Data Analytics** 📊 – *Aug 2025 – Present* (almost done!) 🤘  
- **Google UX Design** 🎨 – *Started but not finishing this one*  

I'm stacking certifications, tinkering with tech, and learning as much as I can while planning my next move. Soon I'll be relocating cross-country 📅 and eventually heading to college once I've built a comfy nest egg 🪴. For now, my goal is to land a tech role in the **$60-80k range** 💸, and down the line I want a **Master's in Computer Science or Computer Engineering** 🎓—leaning toward engineering because I want to understand the hardware side too.  

> Think of this section as my *"in progress"* 🔄—lots of learning, some planning, and a touch of dreaming. ✨
