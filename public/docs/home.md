# Justinwhite.work 🎉

![Alt text](/banners/jwworkbanner2.png)

### Hey! I'm Justin. 👋

I study **computer science**, though I'm not super focused on any single area. My current education leans toward IT. My goal is to work my way into being a **data center engineer** 📀 or a **backend engineer** 🛠️ of some kind.

Outside of work, I like to cook 🍳, bake 🧁, and hike/walk 👟 when it's not a billion degrees.

I also have what I'd consider impeccable music taste 🎵 and interior design sense 🏳️‍🌈 *(or so I'd like to think 😅)*.

## Learning Adventures 📚

Here's what I've been diving into lately:  

- **Google IT Support** 🛠️ – *Sep 2025 – Present*  
- **Google IT Automation** 🤖 – *Aug 2025 - Oct 2025* ✅  
- **Google Project Management** 📋 – *Sep 2025 – Present*  
- **Google Data Analytics** 📊 – *Aug 2025 – Present* (almost done!) 🤘  
- **Google UX Design** 🎨 – *Started but not finishing this one*  

I'm stacking certifications, tinkering with tech, and learning as much as I can while planning my next move. Soon I'll be relocating cross-country 📅 and eventually heading to college once I've built a comfy nest egg 🪴. For now, my goal is to land a tech role in the **$60-80k range** 💸, and down the line I want a **Master's in Computer Science or Computer Engineering** 🎓—leaning toward engineering because I want to understand the hardware side too.  

> Think of this section as my **"in progress"** Im dreaming, learning and acheiving hopefully!

## Current Projects 🚧

### This Portfolio Site 🌐
You're looking at it! Built with **Astro**, **React**, **Tailwind**, **DaisyUI**, and **react-markdown**. The entire thing renders from markdown files, making updates as simple as editing text. It's fast, lightweight, and exactly the kind of problem-solving I enjoy.

### Personal Labs & Experiments 🧪
I'm constantly tinkering with new tech stacks, automation scripts, and side projects. Some make it to production, others teach me what *not* to do next time. Both are valuable.

## What I'm Looking For 🎯

I'm actively seeking opportunities in:
- **Data Center Operations** – I love the idea of working with physical infrastructure and keeping systems running at scale
- **Backend Development** – Building APIs, working with databases, and solving complex logic problems
- **IT Infrastructure** – Network management, system administration, and automation

**Ideal role:** Something that lets me blend technical problem-solving with hands-on work. I want to learn, grow, and eventually specialize while building real-world experience.

**Timeline:** Available for remote or hybrid roles now, relocating cross-country soon. Open to entry-level or junior positions that value potential and work ethic over years of experience.
